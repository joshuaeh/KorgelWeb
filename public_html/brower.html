			<p class="h3">Biography</p>

			<p>Steven Brower's diverse projects involve fabricating various
				aerospace artifacts including space suits, planetary landers, and a
				lunar excursion module permanently installed at the Seattle
				Museum of Space Flight. Brower's multifaceted and expansive work
				appears in educational contexts, film and television productions,
				galleries and museums. BPL, a fictitious aerospace company
				founded by Brower for art purposes, ultimately had to become a
				legitimate business entity, having succeeded in multiple crossdisciplinary
				research efforts with scientists and government entities.</p>

				1. PLAN D (Not in A Million Years)</p>
			</p>

			<p>Artist: Steven Brower</p>

			<p>Dimensions: variable</p>

			<p>Materials: Found objects, HTC Vive VR system, computers, electronics, electronic and mixed media,
				aluminum and plastic.</p>

			<p><b>Statement:</p> </b>

			<p> Prior to finalizing ideas about the content of my submission to this
				project (which technically includes now), I was offered a job in one
				of my other professional lives that would cause me to start over for
				the fourth time. I was hired to design a television miniseries that
				was supposed to use the best scientific thinking to speculate about
				what will happen to the Earth and Humanity over the course of the
				next million years. I was eager to get into this project because it
				touched on many subjects I've had an interest in, among them,
				technology, robotics, architecture, evolution, space travel, transhumanism,
				and most importantly, crackpot schemes. I was very
				curious to see what scientists would do with these notions, which
				are mental exercises really, but which I was supposed to give
				dramatic reality and make plausible and recognizable to a wide
				audience.</p>

			<p> In the course of being a production designer, many ideas are tried
				and rejected for many reasons. Often, the reasons for which ideas
				are discarded are internal to the process of making such a complex
				object/event as a film. These reasons can be attributed to budgets,
				weather, actor availability, coffee spilling on laptops, keys locked in
				cars, food allergies, corporate mergers, Russian Hacking, avarice,
				lack of taste, excess of taste, fine print, sleep deprivation,
				quasitasking, and dyspepsia, to name a few. Very often, ideas are
				not pursued for very good reasons, and after all, the continual
				peristalsis of introducing ideas and rejecting them is intrinsic to any
				creative process. In the case of a 'scientific' speculation such as
				the one I was working on, I realized there was possibly more
				meaning than usual to the rejected ideas, as essentially we would
				be saying to the world 'no, this one, this particular idea, such as
				people cloning themselves for spare parts for instance, won't
				happen in a million years, for whatever reason,' which is hilarious,
				but that's entertainment.</p>

			<p> When scientists are pressed to create science fiction, they often
				hedge, reasonably opting to 'never say never'. But if its true that for
				every event there are an infinite number of non-events, surely an
				eminent figure saying 'In the future people will upload their
				consciousnesses to solid state electronic media and become
				immortal,' is a way of making many more reasonable speculations
				seem outlandish. I started thinking of the rejected ideas as equally
				valid possible futures, no matter what the reason was for their
				unsuitability.</p>

			<p> The client for this series, being a very well known entity, has
				considerable authority and is known primarily for pure
				documentary. The acquisition of this entity by a large network
				known for its pursuit of the blurring of fact and fiction means that
				these new speculative forays will become more common. It seems
				unlikely that the authoritative voice would lose its ability to
				persuade, given high enough 'production values'.</p>

			<p> After a few months of working on the series, despite speculation
				fatigue, I decided to mothball my other plans for the Omnibus Filing
				and focus on presenting my rejected designs, the things that
				WON'T be happening in the next million years. Many of the
				subjects the series was to touch upon had relevance to the work
				being done at UT. Energy production, life sciences,
				nanotechnologies, and work in the humanities all played a big role
				in what was to be dramatized. I thought it would be nice to work
				with some of the conversations and experiences I've had with
				professors and students at UT in the re-presentation of these
				designs of the not-future.</p>

			<p> Many of my favorite bad ideas seem especially well suited for
				'Virtual Reality'. This simulation tool, as is the case with so many
				media, makes a Virtue of promising things everyone knows it can't
				deliver. It seems to me a way to couple this constant dithering over
				the future with a physiologically induced response, which is in itself
				more 'real' than either the VR scenario itself or what it looks like to
				an outside observer. It also seemed perfect since I've never
				worked with this medium before, nor do I have any experience with
				or interest in 'Gaming'.</p>

			<p> In the gallery space, Visitors will be allowed turns wearing an
				apparatus that superimposes alternate realities on a variety of
				commonplace objects situated around the room. A vehicle
				developed for the purposes of transporting the burden of the
				technology around the space as well as serving as feeble agitprop
				will be available for one user at a time. The user's experience will
				parallel mine over the last few months as they interact with designs
				and scenarios that tug at their understanding of pedagogical
				structures. Visitors to the gallery who arrive while someone is
				already using the apparatus will be met with what appears to be a
				classic 'performance art' piece, with the wearer of the apparatus
				interacting with items in the room in ways that might suggest a
				desire to communicate or affect the psychology of the
				audience. Not simply an inward experience, the engagement of VR
				is a witnessed process, and thereby makes its own meaning, and
				creates its own ideas.</p>

			<p> It is not really the intention of this display to say what will or will not
				happen; it is an attempt to create a recurring set of events that in
				some ways has a relationship with the experiences I have had in
				developing projects and also with my particular way of surviving in
				an increasingly mediated environment. It seems to have, as I've
				noticed in the months since I started this project, some metaphorical
				relationship to the way that the world has come to feel upside down
				and inside out; I hope this device, which is thought of sometimes as
				a diversion or an entertainment gadget, also comes to play a part in
				educating and motivating people who must know the difference
				between this world and some kind of nostalgia.</p>
