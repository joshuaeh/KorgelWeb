			<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omnibus Filing, is a legal term used to describe a collection
				of a number of disparate and perhaps unrelated ideas in a single patent application. In the context of
				creative collaboration,
				the intellectual framework of an Omnibus Filing contains A) a mechanism to formalize ideas at the edge
				of imagination and reality, B) a critical dialectic for cross-disciplinary work on the basis
				on invention, and C) a real-world metric of the utility, originality and feasibility of creative
				concepts. The title of this exhibition references this intellectual space both in metaphor and in
				reality,
				and in a cross-disciplinary practice, the lines between the two are blurred. When scientists, engineers,
				artists and researchers collaborate, hypotheticals become realities, daydreams become tangible and
				the optimism of imagination infects the culture of the lab. </p><br />

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise of this exhibition began with the idea that
						artists are everyday innovators, whether they invent a new way to use a material, or create
						machines and processes to realize visions that
						are on the edge of imagination. Acknowledging that both the laboratory and the innovation
						process could vastly benefit from these types of creative disruptions, Asst. Prof. <a
							href="http://www.jamessham.com/">James Sham</a> and <a href="korgel.htm">Dr. Brian
							Korgel</a> devised a program, Rapid Design Pivot,
						to embed artists into the laboratory environment to conduct creative projects alongside and in
						collaboration with UT researchers. The artists in this exhibition, Daniel Bozhkov, Patrick
						Killoran, Steven Brower and James Sham have been inserted
						into various laboratories from 2016-2017 with the mandate to collaborate, cross-pollinate and
						catalyze innovation with UT researchers and scientists. By training the artists in the basic
						skills required to function semi-independently within the
						laboratory environment, the effects and outcomes have been widespread and varied in nature. Some
						projects materialize as contemporary art installation while others manifest as research papers,
						prototypes and demonstrations of emerging technology.
						By releasing artists as a radicalizing presence in the laboratory, research trajectories have
						pivoted and taken radical directions within the contexts of these creative projects. </p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often in the innovation process, finding the right
						application of new materials and technologies is a long, expensive and cumbersome process. After
						achieving amazing and proven results in laboratory, there is often incredible difficulty
						bringing
						emerging technologies and research in the world. The costly, timely and problematic process of
						discovering applications for new materials often nullifies their impact in the world. This
						exhibition began as a way to catalyze innovation by bringing
						artists-specialists in using materials in unexpected ways-into the laboratory environment to
						create projects with experimental new innovations. As a punctuation to these creative
						collaborations, each project has been submitted to the University of
						Texas Office of Technology Commercialization for patent consideration, an arena in which odd
						ideas meet the limit or acceleration of their impact in the world. </p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omnibus Filing showcases a new approach to innovation
						that combines arts, sciences and engineering in a fully collaborative process. Treating UT
						Austin as an innovation hub, artists have worked with researchers, scientists, engineers and
						emerging companies
						to import some radicality and creative disruption into the laboratory environment. The resulting
						projects demonstrate that:<br>

						A) Artists promote collaboration, by fusing the work of vastly different research laboratories
						into cross-disciplinary art projects that lead to new research directions;</br>
						B) Artists catalyze rapid pivots in research direction, by enabling exploration of radically new
						ideas in a short time frame in a way that is not possible within the parameters of directed
						research funding;</br>
						C) Artists provide a direct link between society and the fundamental science and engineering
						work that goes on at a University in the form of tangible projects that bridge the gap between
						the lab-scale prototype and large-scale manufacturing;</br>
						D) Artists create new insight about products and applications that have commercial potential by
						using materials and technologies in unexpected applications within the framework of creative
						projects, rather than directed research.

					<p> The exhibition is now on at Visual arts centre in UT Austin. The exhibit closes on February
						24th.<a href="docs/Omnibusfiling.pdf">Click here</a> to have a look at the exhibition guide.</p>
