			<p class="h3">Biography</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Sham's cross-disciplinary practice focuses on interfacing
				technologies and material processes from a variety of disciplines
				within a contemporary art practice. Sham's work involves multiple
				areas of focus including pigment extraction and using eye-tracking
				technology to study Interpretation in deaf culture. His work has been
				exhibited in many international venues including White Box Gallery
				(NYC), European Cable Network Broadcast (Germany and France),
				the Ellensburg Film Festival (Seattle) and the Asian Arts Initiative
				(Philadelphia) among others. James Sham is an Assistant
				Professor of Innovation Arts at the George Washington University.</p>

			<p class="h3">The Journey</p>



			<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 2013, I met Prof. Brian Korgel in Russia at an
				innovation workshop hosted by MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of
				Science and Technology) and Skoltech (the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology). As a part of
				the workshop, we were
				challenged to develop research proposals that might catalyze innovation in a novel way, to develop new
				models that might be
				possible. Consequently, we developed a program (Rapid Design Pivot) to bring artists directly into the
				laboratory in order to conduct
				research and produce creative projects alongside scientists and engineers. The concept was to import
				extra-disciplinary thinking
				into the lab by enlisting artists to disrupt research conventions through collaboration. At the very
				least we would discover new and
				radical applications for emerging materials and technology, and at the most artists could develop their
				own inventions and innovations,
				empowered by their collaborations with researchers. The hypothesis was that artists might find the field
				of invention and
				innovation permeable enough to explore their own ideas, while also enabling a fruitful intellectual
				space to develop artworks, nonartworks,
				pseudo-artworks and other perhaps yet-to-be defined ideas. </p><br />

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following 3 years has been an ambitious experiment
						in cross-disciplinary collaboration, with results ranging from research
						papers, inventions and prototypes, to artworks and installations. The range of experiences have
						spanned from being physically
						embedded in a laboratory environment as a living space, to virtual cross-continental
						collaborations with A.I. researchers. Some
						conversations occurred in smoky Moscow conference rooms, while others occurred in hidden rooftop
						butterfly conservatories. Some
						breakthroughs happened on the drive to Target, while others happened at 4am alone in the
						isolation of the laboratory. </p>

					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this exhibition is a culmination of 3 years of
						research and work, we hope that it represents a beginning-a beginning of a
						new way to collaborate, cross-pollinate, innovate, produce research, make art, and connect in a
						human way between siloed disciplines.
						The collaborators in this exhibition represent 5 different UT laboratories, 3 different schools,
						2 international tech research
						companies and 1 local Austin-based video production studio. The authors on these projects span
						every level of Academia, with
						laboratory technicians, assistant professors, full professors, soonto- be-retired professors,
						undergraduate, graduate and PhD
						students all listed as co-authors on a variety of projects and publications. Most of these
						collaborators worked on these projects
						in addition to their academic and career duties, donating countless hours as a labour of love.
						My hope is that this ethos will be
						infectious through the results of our efforts, and that viewers will feel empowered to tap into
						the collaborative resources in their own
						communities. </p>

					<p class="h2">
						1. Solar Rock Geodes</p>
					</p>

					<p>Artists: James Sham, <a href="reddy.htm">Vikas Reddy</a>, <a href="houck.htm">Dan Houck</a></p>

					<p>Dimensions: variable</p>

					<p>Materials: Various minerals, geodes and crystals, CIS solar devices, voltage meters.</p>

					<p>Year: 2016-2017</p>

					<p>

					<p><b>Description:</p> </b>

					<p> Each one of these geodes and minerals holds a special energy that expresses itself through
						healing and vibration. Using a proprietary
						CIS nanocrystal ink, each of these specimens has been outfitted with sensors tuned for each
						rock's specific frequency. To activate
						these energy fields, vibrate both hands approximately 3 inches above the surface of the rocks.
						The voltage meters should change
						their readings when you have successfully activated the energy field.</p>

						BloomBot Mini Teaches Poetry</p>
					</p>

					<p>Artists: James Sham, Mark Jennings.</p>

					<p>Dimensions: variable</p>

					<p>Materials: Various Robot Parts, seeds, cracked corn.</p>

					<p>

					<p><b>Description:</p> </b>

					<p> BloomBot Mini is a multi-purpose outdoor land robot that acts as a "seed printer" to produce
						patterns and images in a landscape using
						a variety of media including birdfeed, rice, dog food, seeds and bulbs, sand, salt and other dry
						goods. BloomBot Mini is currently in
						testing phase and in this exhibition has been programmed to teach robot poetry by spelling out
						exemplars and criticism on the ground.
						"Robot Poetry" is an emergent field of creative writing and artificial intelligence research
						focused on poetry written about and by robots,
						including criticism and related literature. In this exhibition, BloomBot Mini "performs" the
						following poetic program:</p>
					<b>1. The Robots by Robert Pinsky </b><br />

					When they choose to take material form they will resemble<br />
					Dragonflies, not machines. Their wings will shimmer.<br />
					Like the chorus of Greek drama they will speak<br />
					As many, but in the first person singular.<br />
					Their colors in the sky will canopy the surface of the earth.<br />
					In varying unison and diapason they will dance the forgotten.<br />
					Their judgment in its pure accuracy will resemble grace and in<br />
					Their circuits the one form of action will be understanding.<br />
					Their exquisite sensors will comprehend our very dust<br />
					And re-create the best and the worst of us, as though in art.<br />

						Meditation Station 2.0</p>
					</p>

					<p>Artists: James Sham.</p>

					<p>Dimensions: variable</p>

					<p>Material: EEG Headset, Meditation Zafu/Zabuton set, switchable glass.</p>

					<p>Year:2017</p>

					<p>

					<p><b>Description:</p> </b>

					<p> Meditation Station 2.0 is an interactive installation where audience members are invited one at
						a time to meditate using an EEG
						headset. Participants must attempt to reach a rather deep threshold state of meditation once
						inside the installation. When a moderate
						level of enlightenment has been reached, the participant's brainwaves will trigger the glass to
						become transparent. Audience
						members can participate by following the instructions below:<br />
						1) Enter Meditation Chamber by crawling. *Alternate entrance
						available for those requiring additional accessibility-please see
						attendant.<br />
						2) Put on EEG Headset. Breathe.<br />
						3) Find a comfortable sitting position on the floor facing the
						pedestal. Breathe.<br />
						4) Focusing your gaze on the pane of glass, take several long slow
						deep breaths. Ground your body in the room, and untether your
						mind. Envision your favorite color in your mind's eye. Envision the
						exact hue, temperature and value of that color for 3 minutes without
						breaking focus. Breathe.<br />
						5) After 3 minutes has passed, focus both your gaze and your
						mind's eye on the glass, with an intention to reach enlightenment.
						Breathe. Repeat until the glass becomes perfectly clear.<br />

						The Impossibility of Empathy</p>
					</p>

					<p>Artists: James Sham.</p>

					<p>Dimensions: variable</p>

					<p>Material: 5-channel video installation.</p>

					<p>Year:2016-2017</p>

					<p>

					<p><b>Description:</p> </b>

					<p> The Impossibility of Empathy documents 6 minutes of the artist's
						spouse in labour during the birth of their first child, and the artist's
						attempts to translate this experience via facial mimesis. The artist
						was filmed at 1/5th speed re-enacting the facial expressions of his
						spouse on green-screen using a teleprompter. The resulting
						footage was synced back to speed and digitally remapped onto the
						original. The installation has 5 channels, which are explained below:</p>
					Channel 1: Green Screen reenactment<br />
					Channel 2: Original Footage<br />
					Channel 3: Image-based face-swap<br />
					Channel 4: Behind the scenes real time footage<br />
					Channel 5: Teleprompter footage<br />
