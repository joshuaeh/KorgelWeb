	<p class="h3">Biography</p>
	
	<p>Daniel Bozhkov is an artist based in New York City, who employs a variety of media, from fresco to performance and video. He works
    with professionals from different fields, and enters the worlds of genetic science, department mega-stores, world-famous touristsites,
   as an amateur intruder/visitor who also functions as a producer of new strains of meaning into seemingly closed
   systems. Daniel Bozhkov is a recipient of 2012 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grant, and 2007 Chuck Close Rome Prize of the
   American Academy in Rome. His work has been presented in international exhibitions such as the 6th Liverpool Biennial, in 2010,
   6th Mercosul Biennial in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 2007, 9th Istanbul Biennale in Turkey in 2005, the 1st Moscow Biennial of
   Contemporary Art in Russia in 2005.</p>

<p class="h2">
1. Hamilton Beach Lab Picnic (better seen through a
telescope across the room)</p>
</p>
<p>Artists: Daniel Bozhkov</p>
<p>Dimensions: variable</p>
<p>Materials: Hamilton Beach sandwich makers, posters, paintings, telescope, instructions for use</p>
<p>Year: 2017</p>
<p> <p><b>Description:</p> </b>
<p> This project presents the original Hamilton Beach Sandwich Maker, designed to make a fast-food breakfast sandwich at home in five minutes, together with three proposals for alternative uses. The
proposals were exchanged for artworks, also presented here.</p>
<p> <b>Invisible ink low-temperature sensor</b></p>
<p>Concept by Tim Siegler, PhD candidate at Korgel Group Nano
Materials Lab
exchanged for a painting by Daniel Bozhkov that uses only the team
colors of the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p><b>Hamilton Beach Dosa Cooker</b></p>
<p>Concept by Vikas Reddy, PhD candidate at Korgel Group Nano
Materials Lab
exchanged for a portrait of himself painted by Daniel Bozhkov</p>
<p><b>Self-gliding doorstop (that keeps the lab door open for 10
minutes so that the sign about concealed weapons in the lab is
invisible under certain conditions).</b></p>
<p>Concept by Daniel Bozhkov
exchanged for a drawing of a tree on the corner of Speedway and
24th Street in Austin</p>

<p class="h2">
2. The Institute for Higher Listening. Location 5 - Austin.
Advanced Nanotechnology for Beginners</p>
</p>
<p>Artists: Daniel Bozhkov</p>
<p>Dimensions: variable</p>
<p>Materials: 4'x 10' banner, video, drawings, household items</p>
<p>Year: 2017</p>
<p> <p><b>Description:</p> </b>
<p> Daniel Bozhkov, with the help of fellow artists Marie Lorenz and Jeff
Williams, built a loft and lived in the 'unused' top six feet of space in
Dr. Brian Korgel's office on the sixth floor of the Norman Hackerman
Building, the location for Korgel Group Nano Materials Lab, at UT.
For the duration of the project, the artist and the scientist conducted
a number of 30-minute sessions at which the scientist explained
one advanced nanotechnology concept per session. The artist
listened carefully, tried to understand to the best of his abilities, then
rested, and responded at the level of his understanding, by
interacting with different objects and spaces inside the building.
The project includes household items used during Daniel Bozhkov's
inhabitation, as well as drawings and a video of these interactions.
Special thanks to Julia Cassel, who helped the artist create the
movements captured in the video.</p>

3. Brief Scenario for Disappearance</p>
</p>
<p>Artists: Daniel Bozhkov</p>
<p>Dimensions: variable</p>
<p>Materials: Video, Photograph</p>
<p>Year: 2017</p>
<p> <p><b>Description:</p> </b>
<p> Daniel Bozhkov's disembodied beard interviews Dr. Andrea Alu,
Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin,
about invisibility and meta-materials. Dr. Alu has been exploring
meta-materials that allow objects to become partially invisible, and
more recently has focused his research on creating a circulator of
acoustic waves that challenges the theoretical symmetry of physical
laws under time reversal transformation. The photograph of a jewel
scarab beetle, Chrysina gloriosa, reflecting Monet's Water Lilies at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was taken during a
discussion between Daniel Bozhkov and Parish Brady, a postdoctoral
research fellow in the Department of Integrative Biology at
UT about Brady's research on invisibility as related to circularly
polarized light.</p>

4. Praxilla, my bumblebee Queen!</p>
</p>
<p>Artists: Daniel Bozhkov</p>
<p>Dimensions: variable</p>
<p>Materials: Bumblebee queen, aerogel, glass enclosure, fresco,
video, cupcakes, painkillers, dry pigment, plastic bag, used
rubber gloves</p>
<p>Year: 2017</p>
<p> <p><b>Description:</p> </b>
<p>This is a mausoleum for a single bumblebee queen.</p>
<p>Praxilla is an American bumblebee, Bombus pensylvanicus, item
#00146801 in the entomology collection of the University of Texas
at Austin. She is named after Praxilla of Sicyon, a Greek lyric poet
of 5th Century BCE, listed by Antipater of Thessalonica as the fist
among nine 'immortal-tongued' women poets.</p>
<p> Praxilla is in a glass enclosure made by Adam Kennedy and
Shallaco McDonald at the scientific glass laboratories of UT
Chemistry Department. She is positioned next to a piece of aerogel,
an extremely porous material, almost as light and airy as a piece of
sky - consisting of 99.8% air. Aerogel was used by NASA in its
Comet Sample Return Mission on the Stardust Spacecraft to
capture interstellar dust and comet particles from Comet Wild 2.</p>
<p>Dr Shalene Jha, an evolutionary biologist at the Department of
Integrated Biology of UT, studied Praxilla, and Alex Wild, a curator
of the entomology collection took a close up photographic portrait of
her. Recitation of the only surviving three-line fragment from Hymn
to Adonis by Praxilla of Sicyon is lead by Evelyn Richardson, PhD
candidate in Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago,
echoed by Daniel Bozhkov, and interspersed with translations and
commentaries of the poem by Stephen White, Professor of Classics
and Philosophy at UT.
The mausoleum includes fresco paintings, an empty plastic bag, 24
cupcakes in a container with painkillers and dry pigments, and
disposable rubber gloves used by the installers of this exhibition.</p>
